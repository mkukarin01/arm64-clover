# arm64-clover & me
__Important__: This page is just a bunch of thoughts about bringing native armv8 OSX Big Sur (I don't know anything about real M1 chip and type of binaries that works on real hardware) to custom ARM development hardware such as [Socionext](https://www.96boards.org/product/developerbox/). At this moment I'm just guessing.

__Motivation__: I'm just curious enough to take this challenge and want review my knowledge about hardware and OS'es. Extra part: I want to have a real argument in discussions about performance of new M1 chip produced by Apple and put my own dot in holywars "x86 vs ARMv8".

__what'a'name__: As Slice mentioned (author of original Clover Bootloader) â€“ "It's your project, so deal with it on your own". Maybe it's some kind of respect, IDK.

# Legal notes
I fully understand that "Hackintosh" and anything related is absolutely Illegal. But as mentioned in [Dortania's Guides](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/why-oc.html#legality-of-hackintoshing) hackintosh itself is not absolutely illegal in case of study and personal use.

So, I putting this as my thoughts with no warranty and so on under BSD-2-Clause License and for academic purposes in reverse engineering and OS studies.
