# arm64-clover & me
__Important__: This page is just a bunch of thoughts about bringing native armv8 OSX Big Sur (I dont know anything about real M1 chip and type of binaries that works on real hardware) to custom ARM development hardware such as [Socionext](https://www.96boards.org/product/developerbox/). At this moment I'm just guessing.

__Motivation__: I'm just curious enough to take this challenge and want review my knowledge about hardware and OS'es. Extra part: I want to have a real argument in discussions about perfomance of new M1 chip produced by Apple and put my own dot in holywars "x86 vs ARMv8".

__what'a'name__: As Slice mentioned (author of original Clover Bootloader) â€“ "Its your project, so deal with it by your own". Maybe it's some kind of respect, IDK.
